## Usage

* Users click the start button on the opening page and are taken to a work with four definition choices to choose from
* When they select an answer, they are alerted below if they answered correctly or incorrectly
* After selecting an answer, there is a 2 second delay before the next quesiton appears
* An incorrect answer subtracts 15 seconds from the time remaining
* The game is over when all questions are answered or the time reaches zero
* When the game is over, the user can enter their initials and their score is saved in local storage

## Images

Below is an image of the first issue I am experiencing - when the user answers, the alert as to whether it is correct or incorrect does not display in the question container, it is instead displayed where the user is alerted the game is over and to enter name:

Below is an image of the second issue I am experiencing - when the user enters their score, just the number is displayed, Your Score: disappears.
